# Introduction to R
## R Operators

The simplest thing you could do with R is arithmetic:

```{r}
1 + 100
```

Here we used to numbers and a `+` sign, which is called an _operator_.
An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical 
or logical manipulations. 

### Arithmetic operators
There are several arithmetic operators we can use and they should look familiar 
to you. If you use several of them (e.g., `5 + 2 *3), the order of operations is 
the same as you would have learned back in school. The list below is arranged 
from highest to lowest precedence:

> ## Arithmetic operations
>
> | Operator     | Description  |
> |:-------------|:-------------|
> |	( )	     | Parentheses  |
> |  `^` or `**` | Exponents    |
> | `/`	        | Divide       |
> | `*`	        | Multiply     |
> | `-`	        | Subtract     |
> | `+`          | Add          |
> 
>
> > ## Examples
> >
> > ```{r}
> > 3 + 5 * 2^5
> > ```
> >
> > Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of
> > evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you
> > intend.
> > 
> > ```{r}
> > ((3 + 5) * 2)^5
> > ```
> > 
> > Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:
> > 
> > ```{r}
> > 2/10000
> > ```
> > 
> > You can write numbers in scientific notation too:
> > 
> > ```{r}
> > 5e3 
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .checklist}

Like bash, if you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it. Any time you hit return and the R session shows a `+` instead of a 
`>`, it means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel
a command you can simply hit "Esc" and RStudio will give you back the `>`
prompt.

> ## Tip: Cancelling commands
>
> If you're using R from the commandline instead of from within RStudio,
> you need to use `Ctrl+C` instead of `Esc` to cancel the command. This
> applies to Mac users as well!
>
> Cancelling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:
> you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if its
> taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're
> currently writing.

### Relational Operators

R also has relational operators that allow us to do comparison:

> ## R Relational Operators
>
> | Operator | Description  |
> |:---------|:-------------|
> | <	        | Less than    |
> | >  	     | Greater than |
> | <=	     | Less than or equal to |
> | >=	     | Greater than or equal to |
> | ==	     | Equal to     |
> | !=	     | Not equal to |
> 
> > ## Examples
> > ```{r}
> > 1 == 1; # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")  
> > 1 != 1; # inequality (read as "is not equal to") 
> > 1 <  2; # less than  
> > # etc
> > ```
> > 
> {: .solution}
{: .checklist}

> ## Comparing Numbers
>
> Let's compare `0.1 + 0.2` and `0.3`. What do you think?
>  ```{r}
>  0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
>  ```
> What's happened?   
> Computers may only represent decimal numbers with a
> certain degree of precision, so two numbers which look
> the same when printed out by R, may actually have
> different underlying representations and therefore be
> different by a small margin of error (called Machine
> numeric tolerance).
> So, unless you compare two integers, you should use the `all.equal` function:
>  ```{r}
>  all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
>  ```

### Other operators
There are several other types of operators:

- Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Miscellaneous Operators

We will see some of them in the next section and talk more about them in latter 
lessons (but see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_operators.htm) if you 
can't wait). Before we do it, we need to introduce variables.

## Variables and assignment

A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. 
We can store values in variables using the _assignment operator_ `<-`:

```{r}
x <- 1/40
```

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:

```{r}
x
```

Look for the `Environment` tab in one of the panes of RStudio, and you will see 
that `x` and its value have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a 
number in any calculation that expects a number:

```{r}
x^2
```

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:

```{r}
x <- 100
```

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:

```{r}
x <- x + 1; #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
x
```

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

> ## Tip: A shortcut for assignment operator
>
> IN RStudio, you can create the <- assignment operator in one keystroke 
> using `Option -` (that's a dash) on OS X or `Alt -` on Windows/Linux.
>
{: .callout}

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x = 1/40
```

But this is much less common among R users. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

> ## Naming variables
> Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They
> cannot start with a number nor contain spaces at all. Different people use
> different conventions for long variable names, these include
>  * periods.between.words
>  * underscores\_between_words
>  * camelCaseToSeparateWords
> What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.
>
> #### Warning:
> Notice, that R does not use a special symbol to distinguish between variable
> and simple text. Instead, the text is placed in double quotes "text".
> If R complains that the object *text* does not exist, you probably forgot to 
> use the quotes!
>
> #### Reserved words
> Reserved words in R programming are a set of words that have special meaning 
> and cannot be used as an identifier (variable name, function name etc.).
> To view the list of reserved words you can type `help(reserved)` or `?reserved`
> at the R command prompt.

## Vectorization

One final thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorized*, meaning that
variables and functions can have vectors as values. We can create vectors using 
several commands:

> ## Vectorization
>
> | Command             | Description                                 |
> |:--------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
> | `c(2, 4, 6)`        | Join elements into a vector                 |
> | `1:5`               | Create an integer sequence                  |
> | `seq(2, 3, by=0.5)` | Create a sequence with a specific increment |
> | `rep(1:2, times=3)` | Repeat a vector                             |
> | `rep(1:2, each=3)`  | Repeat elements of a vector                 |
> 
> > ## Examples
> > 
> > ```{r}
> > 1:5;
> > 2^(1:5);
> > x <- 1:5;
> > 2^x;
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .checklist}

This is incredibly powerful; we will discuss this further in an
upcoming lesson.

Notice that in the table above we see some functions that can be recognized by 
parenthesis that follow one or more letters (e.g., `seq(2, 3, by=0.5)`). R has 
many in-built functions which can be directly called in the program without 
defining them first. We can also create and use our own functions referred as 
user defined functions. You can see some additional examples of in-build 
functions in this handy [Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf)

## Managing your environment

There are a few useful commands you can use to interact with the R session. 

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):

```{r}
ls() # to list files use list.files() function
```

> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> Like in the shell, `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting
> with a "." by default. To list all objects, type `ls(all.names=TRUE)`
> instead
>
{: .callout}

Note here that we didn't given any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

If we type `ls` by itself, R will print out the source code for that function!

```{r}
ls
```

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(x)
```

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

In this case we've combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.


> ## Tip: Warnings vs. Errors
>
> Pay attention when R does something unexpected! Errors, like above,
> are thrown when R cannot proceed with a calculation. Warnings on the
> other hand usually mean that the function has run, but it probably
> hasn't worked as expected.
>
> In both cases, the message that R prints out usually give you clues
> how to fix a problem.
>
{: .callout}

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
obtaining a package written by someone else. There
are over 7,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

## Writing your own code

Good coding style is like using correct punctuation. You can manage without it, 
but it sure makes things easier to read. As with styles of punctuation, there 
are many possible variations. [Google’s R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) 
is a good place to start. The [formatR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/formatR/index.html) 
package, by Yihui Xie, makes it easier to clean up poorly formatted code. 
Make sure to read the notes on the [wiki](https://github.com/yihui/formatR/wiki) 
before using it.

## Looking for help

### Reading Help files

R, and every package, provide help files for functions. To search for help use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?function_name
help(function_name)
```

This will load up a help page in RStudio (or as plain text in R by itself).

Note that each help page is broken down into several sections, including
Description, Usage, Arguments, Examples, etc.

### Operators

To seek help on operators, use quotes:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?"+"
```

### Getting help on packages

Many packages come with "vignettes": tutorials and extended example documentation.
Without any arguments, `vignette()` will list all vignettes for all installed packages;
`vignette(package="package-name")` will list all available vignettes for
`package-name`, and `vignette("vignette-name")` will open the specified vignette.

If a package doesn't have any vignettes, you can usually find help by typing
`help("package-name")`.

### When you kind of remember the function

If you're not sure what package a function is in, or how it's specifically spelled you can do a fuzzy search:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
??function_name
```

### When you have no idea where to begin

If you don't know what function or package you need to use
[CRAN Task Views](http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/views)
is a specially maintained list of packages grouped into
fields. This can be a good starting point.

### When your code doesn't work: seeking help from your peers

If you're having trouble using a function, 9 times out of 10,
the answers you are seeking have already been answered on
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). You can search using
the `[r]` tag.

If you can't find the answer, there are two useful functions to
help you ask a question from your peers:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?dput
```

Will dump the data you're working with into a format so that it can
be copy and pasted by anyone else into their R session.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

Will print out your current version of R, as well as any packages you
have loaded.

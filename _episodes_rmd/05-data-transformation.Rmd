## Introduction

Every data analysis you conduct will likely involve manipulating dataframes at 
some point. Quickly extracting, transforming, and summarizing information from 
dataframes is an essential R skill. In this part we'll use Hadley Wickham’s 
`dplyr` package, which consolidates and simplifies many of the common operations 
we perform on dataframes. In addition, much of `dplyr` key functionality is 
written in C++ for speed.

## Preliminaries
#### Inatall (if needed) and/or load two libraries, `tidyverse` and `tidyr`:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
```

> ## Dataset
>
> Following chapter 8 of the Buffalo's book, we will use the dataset Dataset_S1.txt from the paper 
> "[The Influence of Recombination on Human Genetic Diversity](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020148)".
> The dataset contains estimates of population genetics statistics such 
> as nucleotide diversity (e.g., the columns Pi and Theta), recombination (column Recombination), and sequence 
> divergence as estimated by percent identity between human and chimpanzee genomes (column Divergence). 
> Other columns contain information about the sequencing depth (depth), and GC content 
> (percent.GC) for 1kb windows in human chromosome 20. We’ll only work with a few columns in our examples; 
> see the description of Dataset_S1.txt in the original paper for more details.
>
{: .callout}

#### Download the dataset

We can download the Dataset_S1.txt file into a local folder of your choice using 
the `download.file` function. Instead, we will read file directly from the 
Internet with the `read_csv` function:

```{r eval=TRUE}
dvst <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/master/chapter-08-r/Dataset_S1.txt")
```

Notice the parsing of columns in the file. Also notice that some of the columns names 
contain spaces and special characters. We'll replace them soon to facilitate typing.

We can check the data structure creates with either the `str(dvst)` command or by
typing `dvst`:

```{r eval=TRUE}
dvst
```

**It's a tibble!**. Notice that the tibble only shows the first few rows and all 
the columns that fit on one screen. 

Run `View(dvst)`, which will open the dataset in the RStudio viewer, to see the 
whole dataframe. 

Also notice that there are some additional variable types available:

| Abbreviation | Variable type            |
|:------------|:----------------------------|
| `int`       | integers                    |
| `dbl`       | doubles (real numbers)      |
| `fctr`      | factors (categorical)       |
| **Variables**| **not in the dataset**   |
| `chr`       | character vectors (strings) |
| `dttm`      | date-time                   |
| `lgl`       | logical                     |
| `date`      | dates                       |

## `dplyr` basics

There are **five key dplyr functions** that allow you to solve the vast majority 
of data manipulation challenges:

> | `filter()`   | Pick observations by their values                    |

> | `mutate()`   | Create new variables with functions of existing variables |
> | `summarise()`| Collapse many values down to a single summary        |
> 
{: .checklist}

None of these functions perform tasks you can’t accomplish with R’s base functions. 
But dplyr’s advantage is in the added consistency, speed, and versatility of its 
data manipulation interface. Get this 
[cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) 
to keep as a reminder of these and several additional functions. 

### `group_by` function

`dplyr` functions can be used in conjunction with `group_by()`, which changes 
the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on 
it group-by-group. 

### Overall command structure

All dplyr functions work similarly: 

1.  The first argument is a data frame (actually, a `tibble`).

1.  The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame,
    using the variable names (without quotes).
    
1.  The result is a new data frame.

Together these properties make it easy to chain together multiple simple steps 
to achieve a complex result.

These six functions provide the verbs for a language of 
data manipulation. Let's dive in and see how these verbs work.

---

## Use `filter()` to filter rows

Let's say we used `summary` to get an idea about the total number of SNPs in 
different windows:

```{r}
summary(select(dvst,`total SNPs`)) # Here we also used `select` function. We'll talk about it soon.
```

The number varies considerably across all windows on chromosome 20 
and the data are right-skewed: the third quartile is 12 SNPs, but the maximum is 
93 SNPs. Often we want to investigate such outliers more closely. 

We can use `filter()` to extract the rows of our dataframe based on their values. 
The first argument is the name of the data frame. The second and subsequent 
arguments are the expressions that filter the data frame.

```{r}
filter(dvst,`total SNPs` >= 85)
```

> ## Questions:
> 
> - How many windows have >= 85 SNPs?  
> - What is a SNP?
{: .discussion}

We can build more elaborate queries by using multiple filters:

```{r}
filter(dvst, Pi > 16, `%GC` > 80)
```

Note, **dplyr functions never modify their inputs**, so if you want to save the 
result, you'll need to use the assignment operator, `<-`:

```{r}
new_df <- filter(dvst, Pi > 16, `%GC` > 80)
```

> ## Tip
>
> R either prints out the results, or saves them to a variable. If you want to 
do both, you can wrap the assignment in parentheses:
> 
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> (new_df <- filter(dvst, Pi > 16, `%GC` > 80))
> ```
{: .callout}

### Comparisons

Use comparison operators to filter effectively: 
`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal). 
Remember, that `==` does not work well with real numbers! Use the dplyr `near` 
function instead!

### Logical operators

Multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with "and": every expression must 
be true in order for a row to be included in the output. For other types of 
combinations, you'll need to use Boolean operators 
yourself: `&` is "and", `|` is "or", and `!` is "not". The figure below shows 
the complete set of Boolean operations.

```{r bool-ops, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Complete set of boolean operations. `x` is the left-hand circle, `y` is the right-hand circle, and the shaded region show which parts each operator selects."}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/transform-logical.png")
```

### `x %in% y` operator

If you are looking for multiple values within a certain column, use the `x %in% y` 
operator. This will select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`:

```{r}
filter(dvst, `total SNPs` %in% c(0,1,2))
```

Finally, whenever you start using complicated, multipart expressions in `filter()`, 
consider making them explicit variables instead. That makes it much easier to 
check your work. We'll learn how to create new variables shortly.

> ## Missing values
>  
> One important feature of R that can make comparison tricky are missing values, or `NA`s ("not availables"). 
> `NA` represents an unknown value so missing values are "contagious": almost any operation involving an unknown 
> value will also be unknown.
>  
> > ## Examples:
> > 
> >  ```{r}
> >  NA > 5
> >  10 == NA
> >  NA + 10
> >  NA / 2
> >  NA == NA
> >  ```
> {: .solution}
{: .callout}

`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE`; it excludes both 
`FALSE` and `NA` values. If you want 
to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(dvst, is.na(Divergence))
```

---

## Use `mutate() to add new variables`

It's often useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. 
That's the job of `mutate()`. `mutate()` always adds new columns at the end of 
your dataset. Remember that when you're in RStudio, the easiest way to see all 
the columns is with `View()`.

Here we'll add an additional column that indicates whether a window is in the 
centromere region (nucleotides 25,800,000 to 29,700,000, based on Giemsa banding; 
see [README](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/blob/master/chapter-08-r/README.md) for details). 

We'll call it `cent` and make it logical (with TRUE/FALSE values):

```{r}
mutate(dvst, cent = start >= 25800000 & end <= 29700000)
dvst
```

> ## Question:
>
> Why don't we see the column in the dataset? 
>
{: .discussion}

In the dataset we are using, the diversity estimate Pi is measured per sampling 
window (1kb) and scaled up by 10x (see supplementary Text S1 for more details). 
It would be useful to have this scaled as per basepair nucleotide diversity 
(so as to make the scale more intuitive).

```{r}
mutate(dvst, diversity = Pi / (10*1000)) # rescale, removing 10x and making per bp
```

Notice, that we can combine the two operations in a single command (and also save the result):

```{r}
dvst <- mutate(dvst, 
       diversity = Pi / (10*1000), 
       cent = start >= 25800000 & end <= 29700000
)
```

If you only want to keep the new variables, use `transmute()`:

```{r}
transmute(dvst,
  diversity = Pi / (10*1000), 
  cent = start >= 25800000 & end <= 29700000
)
```

## Use `arrange()` to arrange rows

`arrange()` works similarly to `filter()` except that instead of selecting rows, 
it changes their order. It takes a data frame and a set of column names (or more 
complicated expressions) to order by. If you provide more than one column name, 
each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding 
columns:

```{r}
arrange(dvst, cent, `%GC`)
```

Use `desc()` to re-order by a column in descending order:

```{r}
arrange(dvst, desc(cent), `%GC`)
```

Note, that missing values are always sorted at the end!

## Use `select()` to select columns and `rename()` to rename them

`select()` is not terribly useful with our data because they only have a few 
variables, but you can still get the general idea:

```{r}
# Select columns by name
select(dvst, start, end, Divergence)
# Select all columns between depth and Pi (inclusive)
select(dvst, depth:Pi)
# Select all columns except those from start to percent.GC (inclusive)
select(dvst, -(start:`%GC`))
```

`select()` can also be used to rename variables, but it's rarely useful because 
it drops all of the variables not explicitly mentioned. Instead, use `rename()`, 
which is a variant of `select()` that keeps all the variables that aren't 
explicitly mentioned:

```{r}
dvst <- rename(dvst, total.SNPs = `total SNPs`,
       total.Bases = `total Bases`,
       unique.SNPs = `unique SNPs`,
       reference.Bases = `reference Bases`,
       percent.GC = `%GC`) #renaming all the columns that require ` `!
colnames(dvst)
```

Another option is to use `select()` in conjunction with the `everything()` helper. 
This is useful if you have a handful of variables you'd like to move to the start 
of the data frame:

```{r}
select(dvst, cent, everything())
```

---

## Use `summarise()` to make summaries

The last key verb is `summarise()`. It collapses a data frame to a single row:

```{r}
summarise(dvst, GC = mean(percent.GC, na.rm = TRUE), averageSNPs=mean(total.SNPs, 
na.rm = TRUE), allSNPs=sum(total.SNPs))
```

`summarise()` is not terribly useful unless we pair it with `group_by()`. 
This changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups. 
Then, when you use the dplyr verbs on a grouped data frame they'll be 
automatically applied "by group". For example, if we applied exactly the same 
code to a data frame grouped by position related to centromere:

```{r}
by_cent <- group_by(dvst, cent)
summarise(by_cent, GC = mean(percent.GC, na.rm = TRUE), averageSNPs=mean(total.SNPs, na.rm = TRUE), allSNPs=sum(total.SNPs))
```

Subsetting columns can be a useful way to summarize data across two different conditions. 
For example, we might be curious if the average depth in a window (the depth column) 
differs between very high GC content windows (greater than 80%) and all other windows:

```{r}
by_GC <- group_by(dvst, percent.GC >= 80)
summarize(by_GC, depth=mean(depth))
```

This is a fairly large difference, but it’s important to consider how many windows this includes. 
Whenever you do any aggregation, it's always a good idea to include either a count (`n()`), 
or a count of non-missing values (`sum(!is.na(x))`). That way you can check that you're not 
drawing conclusions based on very small amounts of data:

```{r}
summarize(by_GC, mean_depth=mean(depth), n_rows=n())
```

> *   Measures of location: we've used `mean(x)`, but `median(x)` is also useful.

> *   Measures of position: `first(x)`, `nth(x, 2)`, `last(x)`. These work

Together `group_by()` and `summarise()` provide one of the tools that you'll use 
most commonly when working with dplyr: grouped summaries. But before we go any 
further with this, we need to introduce a powerful new idea: the pipe.

### Combining multiple operations with the pipe

It looks like we have been creating and naming several intermediate files in our 
analysis, even though we didn't care about them. Naming things is hard, so this 
slows down our analysis. 

There's another way to tackle the same problem with the pipe, `%>%`:

```{r}
dvst %>%
  rename(GC.percent = percent.GC) %>%
  group_by(GC.percent >= 80) %>%
  summarize(mean_depth=mean(depth, na.rm = TRUE), n_rows=n())
```

This focuses on the transformations, not what's being transformed. 
You can read it as a series of imperative statements: group, then summarise, then 
filter, 
where `%>%` stands for "then".

Behind the scenes, `x %>% f(y)` turns into `f(x, y)`, and `x %>% f(y) %>% g(z)` 
turns into `g(f(x, y), z)` and so on.

Working with the pipe is one of the key criteria for belonging to the tidyverse. 
The only exception is `ggplot2`: it was written before the pipe was discovered. 
However, the next iteration of `ggplot2`, `ggvis`, is supposed to use the pipe. 

> ## RStudio Tip
> A shortcut for `%>%` is available in the newest RStudio releases under the keybinding 
> CTRL + SHIFT + M (or CMD + SHIFT + M for OSX).  
> You can also review the set of available keybindings when within RStudio with 
> the ALT + SHIFT + K.

{: .callout}


> ## Missing values
>
> You may have wondered about the `na.rm` argument we used above. What happens if we don't set it? 
> We may get a lot of missing values! That's because aggregation functions obey the usual rule of 
> missing values: if there's any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. Fortunately, 
> all aggregation functions have an `na.rm` argument which removes the missing values prior to computation:
> We could have also removed all the rows that have uknown position value prior to the analysis with the 
> `filter(!is.na())` command
>
{: .callout}

Finally, one of the best features of dplyr is that all of these same methods 
also work with database connections. For example, you can manipulate a SQLite 
database with all of the same verbs we’ve used here.

## Introduction

> than any other device." --- John Tukey

In this lesson we will learn how to visualise your data using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). 
R has several systems for making graphs, but ggplot2 is probably the most versatile. 
ggplot2 implements the [__grammar of graphics__](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf), 
a coherent system for describing and building graphs. 
With ggplot2, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.

The lesson is based on Chapter 8 of the [Bioinformatics Data Skills](BDS) book by Vince Buffalo 
and Chapter 2 of the [R for Data Science](R for Data Science) book by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

### Prerequisites

ggplot2 is one of the core members of the tidyverse. So begin by loading it with:


~~~
library(tidyverse)
# I assume it is installed by now, but see previous episodes if you get an error message!
~~~
{: .language-r}

## Dataset

We will again use the dataset Dataset_S1.txt from the paper 
"[The Influence of Recombination on Human Genetic Diversity](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020148)".  
See the previous lesson for its description.
<!-- As a reminder, it contains estimates of population genetics statistics such 
as nucleotide diversity (e.g., the columns Pi and Theta), recombination (column Recombination), 
and sequence divergence as estimated by percent identity between human and chimpanzee genomes 
(column Divergence). Other columns contain information about the sequencing depth (depth), 
and GC content (percent.GC) for 1kb windows in human chromosome 20.
-->

Let's read it as a tibble and modify as we did before:


~~~
dvst <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/master/chapter-08-r/Dataset_S1.txt") %>% 
  mutate(diversity = Pi / (10*1000), cent = (start >= 25800000 & end <= 29700000)) %>% 
  rename(percent.GC = `%GC`, total.SNPs = `total SNPs`, total.Bases = `total Bases`, reference.Bases = `reference Bases`)
~~~
{: .language-r}

## Exploring Data Visually with ggplot2 I: Scatterplots and Densities

We'll start by using ggplot2 to create a scatterplot of nucleotide diversity along the chromosome. 
But because our data is window-based, we’ll first add a column called position that’s 
the midpoint for each window:


~~~
dvst <- mutate(dvst, position = (end + start) / 2)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Now we make a ggplot:


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=position, y=diversity))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

> ## Note
> With ggplot2, you begin a plot with the function `ggplot()`. `ggplot()` creates a 
> coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of `ggplot()` is 
> the dataset to use in the graph. So `ggplot(data = dvrs)` creates an empty graph.
>
> You complete your graph by adding one or more layers to `ggplot()`. 
> `geom_point()`is a type of geometric object (or geom in ggplot2 lingo) that creates

> 
> Each geom function in ggplot2 takes a `mapping` argument. This defines how variables 
> in your dataset are mapped to visual properties. The `mapping` argument is always 
> paired with `aes()`, and the `x` and `y` arguments of `aes()` specify which variables 
> to map to the x and y axes. ggplot2 looks for the mapped variable in the `data` 
> argument, in this case, `dvst`.
{: .callout}

### A graphing template

We can use the code above to make a reusable template for making graphs with ggplot2. 
To make a graph, replace the bracketed sections in the code below with a dataset, a geom function, or a collection of mappings.


~~~
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
~~~
{: .language-r}

ggplot2 has many geoms (e.g., `geom_line()`, `geom_bar()`, etc). We'll talk about them later.

### Aesthetic mappings

> "The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we
> never expected to see." --- John Tukey

Notice the missing diversity estimates in the middle of this plot. What’s going on in this region? 
We can explore this question easily in ggplot by mapping a possible confounder or explanatory variable to another 
aesthetic. In this case, let’s map the color aesthetic of our point geometric objects to the column cent, 
which indicates whether the window falls in the centromeric region of this chromosome


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=position, y=diversity, color=cent))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<!-- other
In the above example, we mapped `cent` to the color aesthetic, but we could have mapped it to 
shape of the points or their transparency with `shape = cent` and `alpha = cent`. 

aesthetic in the same way. Here are examples of mapping `cent` to the _alpha_ aesthetic, which controls 
the transparency of the points, or the shape of the points.


~~~
# Left
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = position, y = diversity, alpha = cent))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="50%" />

~~~
# Right
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = position, y = diversity, shape = cent))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-7-2.png" width="50%" />

This did not work so well, but you should get an idea!
-->

> ## Note
> Geometric objects have many aesthetic attributes (e.g., color, shape, size, etc.). 
> The beauty of ggplot2s grammar is that it allows you to map geometric objects’ 
> aesthetics to columns in your dataframe. The `aes()` function gathers together each 
> of the aesthetic mappings used by a layer and passes them to the layer's mapping argument. 
> The syntax highlights a useful insight about `x` and `y`: the x and y locations of a point 
> are themselves aesthetics, visual properties that you can map to variables to display 
> information about the data. 
> Once you map an aesthetic, ggplot2 takes care of the rest. It selects a reasonable scale 
> to use with the aesthetic, and it constructs a legend that explains the mapping between 
> levels and values. For x and y aesthetics, ggplot2 does not create a legend, but it 
> creates an axis line with tick marks and a label. The axis line acts as a legend: it 
> explains the mapping between locations and values.
{: .callout}

You can also _set_ the aesthetic properties of your geom manually. For example, we can make 
all of the points in our plot blue:


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = position, y = diversity), color = "blue")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Here, the color doesn't convey information about a variable, but only changes the 
appearance of the plot. To set an aesthetic manually, set the aesthetic by name 
as an argument of your geom function; i.e. it goes _outside_ of `aes()`. You'll 
need to pick a value that makes sense for that aesthetic:

* The name of a color as a character string.
* The size of a point in mm.
* The shape of a point as a number, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:shapes).

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-shapes-1.png" title="R has 25 built in shapes that are identified by numbers. There are some seeming duplicates: for example, 0, 15, and 22 are all squares. The difference comes from the interaction of the `colour` and `fill` aesthetics.

Finally, note, that aesthetic mappings can also be specified in the call to ggplot(); 
different geoms will then use this mapping:


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst, mapping = (aes(x=position, y=diversity))) + geom_point()

### Overplotting
One problem with scatterplots (and our plot in particular) is overplotting (some data points obscure 
the information of other data points). We can’t get a sense of the distribution of diversity from this 
figure because everything is saturated from about 0.05 and below. One way to alleviate overplotting is to make 
points somewhat transparent (the transparency level is known as the alpha):


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=position, y=diversity), alpha=0.01)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Note that we set alpha=0.01 outside of the aesthetic mapping function aes() as we did with the color in
the previous example. This is because we’re not mapping the alpha aesthetic to a column of data in our dataframe, 
but rather givi0ng it a fixed value for all data points.

### Density
Let’s now look at the density of diversity across all positions. We’ll use a different geometric object, 
`geom_density()`, which is slightly different than `geom_point()` in that it takes the data and calculates 
a density from it for us:


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_density(mapping = aes(x=diversity), fill="blue")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can also map the color aesthetic of `geom_density()` to a discrete-valued column in our dataframe, 
just as we did with `geom_point()`. `geom_density()` will create separate density plots, grouping data 
by the column mapped to the color aesthetic and using colors to indicate the different densities. 
To see both overlapping densities, we use alpha to set the transparency to 0.4:


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_density(mapping = aes(x=diversity, fill=cent), alpha=0.4)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-13" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-13" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Immediately we’re able to see a trend that wasn’t clear by using a scatterplot: diversity is 
skewed to more extreme values in centromeric regions. Again (because this point is worth repeating), 
mapping columns to additional aesthetic attributes can reveal patterns and information in the data 
that may not be apparent in simple plots. 

## Exploring Data Visually with ggplot2 II: Smoothing
Let’s look at the Dataset_S1.txt data using another useful ggplot2 feature: smoothing. 
In particular, we'll investigate potential confounders in genomic data. There are several
potential factor that influence our estimates: sequencing read depth; 
GC content; mapability, or whether a region is capable of having reads correctly align 
to it; batch effects; etc. Often with large and high-dimension datasets, visualization 
is the easiest and best way to spot these potential issues.

Earlier, we used transparency to give us a sense of the most dense regions. Another 
strategy is to use ggplot2’s `geom_smooth()` to add a smoothing line to plots and look 
for an unexpected trend. Let’s use a scatterplot and smoothing curve to look at the 
relationship between the sequencing depth (the depth column) and the total number of 
SNPs in a window (the total.SNPs column):


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst, mapping = aes(x=depth, y=total.SNPs)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) + geom_smooth()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'
~~~
{: .output}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Notice that because both `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()` use the same x and y mapping, we can specify 
the aesthetic in `ggplot()` function.

## Binning Data with `cut(`) and Bar Plots with ggplot2

Next, let's take a look at a bar chart. Bar charts seem simple, but they reveal something subtle about plots. 
Consider a basic bar chart, as drawn with `geom_bar()`. As you can see, there are ~60000 windows in the dataset, 
most of them outside the centromeric region. 


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cent))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-17" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-17" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

On the x-axis, the chart displays `cent`, a variable from `dvst`. On the y-axis, it displays count,
but count is not a variable in `dvst`! Where does count come from? Many graphs, like scatterplots, 
plot the raw values of your dataset. Other graphs, like bar charts, calculate new values to plot:

* bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data 
  and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.

* smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the
  model.

* boxplots compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display a 
  specially formatted box.

The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a __stat__, short for statistical transformation. 
For example, `geom_bar()` uses `stat_count()` that simply counts the number of observations.

<!--

### Grouping data
So far we used `cent`, the only discrete variable in our dataset.  Let's create another one by
splitting the percent.GC into 5 categories:


~~~
dvst <- dvst %>% 
  mutate(GC.binned = cut(percent.GC, 5));
select(dvst, GC.binned)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 59,140 x 1
   GC.binned  
   <fct>      
 1 (51.6,68.5]
 2 (34.7,51.6]
 3 (34.7,51.6]
 4 (34.7,51.6]
 5 (34.7,51.6]
 6 (34.7,51.6]
 7 (34.7,51.6]
 8 (34.7,51.6]
 9 (34.7,51.6]
10 (17.7,34.7]
# … with 59,130 more rows
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=GC.binned))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-23" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-23" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The bins created from `cut()` are useful in grouping data (a concept we often use in data analysis). 
For example, we can use the GC.binned column to group data by %GC content bins to see how GC content 
has an impact on other variables. To do this, we map aesthetics like color, fill, or linetype to our GC.binned column:


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_density(mapping = aes(x=depth, linetype=GC.binned), alpha=0.5)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-24" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-24" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

What happens if we geom_bar()’s x aesthetic is mapped to a continuous column (e.g., percent.GC)? 
geom_bar() will automatically bin the data itself, creating a histogram:


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=percent.GC))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-25" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-25" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

But it does not look like the plot we had!  Hence, the challenge:

## Position adjustments

There's one more piece of magic associated with bar charts. You can color a bar chart using 
either the `colour` aesthetic, or, more usefully, `fill`:


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = GC.binned, colour = GC.binned))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-26" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-26" width="50%" />

~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = GC.binned, fill = GC.binned))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-26-2.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-26" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-26" width="50%" />

But what happen if you map the fill aesthetic to another variable, like `cent`? The bars are automatically stacked! 
Each colored rectangle represents a combination of `GC.binned` and `cent`.


~~~
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = GC.binned, fill = cent))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-27" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-27" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The stacking is performed automatically by the __position adjustment__ specified by the `position` argument. If you don't want a stacked bar chart, you can use one of three other options: `"identity"`, `"dodge"` or `"fill"`.

*   `position = "identity"` will place each object exactly where it falls in 
    the context of the graph. This is not very useful for bars, because it
    overlaps them. However, the identity position adjustment is more useful for 2d geoms, like points,
    where it is the default.
    
*   `position = "fill"` works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars
    the same height. This makes it easier to compare proportions across 
    groups.

    
    ~~~
    ggplot(data = dvst) + 
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = GC.binned, fill = cent), position = "fill")

*   `position = "dodge"` places overlapping objects directly _beside_ one 
    another. This makes it easier to compare individual values.

    
    ~~~
    ggplot(data = dvst) + 
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = GC.binned, fill = cent), position = "dodge")

<!--
There's one other type of adjustment that's not useful for bar charts, but can be very useful for scatterplots, **jitter**. `position = "jitter"` adds a small amount of random noise to each point. 
This spreads the points and expose those that othewise will be hidden by overplotting:


~~~
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-30-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-30" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-30" width="50%" />

~~~
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), position = "jitter")

{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-30-2.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-30" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-30" width="50%" />

Adding randomness seems like a strange way to improve your plot, but while it makes your graph less accurate at small scales, it makes your graph _more_ revealing at large scales. Because this is such a useful operation, ggplot2 comes with a shorthand for `geom_point(position = "jitter")`: `geom_jitter()`.

## Using ggplot2 Facets

Now we'll return for a minute to data manipulation and create a new tbl by merging two additional datasets available in Buffalo's 
bds-files GitHub repository for chapter 8. We start by reading these datasets with `read_tsv`:


~~~
#Read datasets
mtfs <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/master/chapter-08-r/motif_recombrates.txt")
rpts <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/master/chapter-08-r/motif_repeats.txt")
~~~

These two datasets come from a study that explored recombination rates around a degenerate sequence motif that is 
common in some repeat classes.
The first dataset contains estimates of the recombination rate for all windows within 40kb of each of the two motif
variants.  The second dataset contains info about repeats each motif occur in. Our goal will be to merge these two 
datasets to look at the effect of specific repeat background on recombination rate. 

Here is the plan: 
1. combine _chr_, and *motif_start* columns in `rpts` as _pos_ with `unite`, 
1. select this new column along with the *name* column, and 
1. join these two columns with the columns in the `mtfs` with `inner_join`. 
   Note, [there are several ways](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html) you can join to two dataframes.


~~~
#Combine columns
rpts2 <- rpts %>% 
  unite(pos, chr, motif_start, sep="-") %>% 
  select(name, pos) %>% 
  inner_join(mtfs, by="pos")
~~~
{: .language-r}

We will now explore these data using visualization technique known as facets. 
Facets allow us to visualize grouped data by creating a series of separate 
adjacent plots for each group. Let’s first glimpse at the relationship between 
recombination rate and distance to a motif. We’ll construct this graphic in steps:


~~~
p <- ggplot(data = rpts2, mapping = aes(x=dist, y=recom)) + geom_point(size=1)
p <- p + geom_smooth(method="loess", se=FALSE, span=1/10)
print(p)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'
~~~
{: .output}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-34" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-34" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that we’ve turned off `geom_smooth()`’s standard error estimates, 
adjusted the smoothing with `span`, and set the smoothing method to "loess".  

From this data, we only see a slight bump in the smoothing curve where 
the motifs reside. However, this data is a convolution of two different 
motif sequences on many different genomic backgrounds. In other words, 
there’s a large amount of heterogeneity we’re not accounting for, and 
this could be washing out our signal. Let’s use faceting to pick apart this data.

First, if you’ve explored the `rpts` dataframe, you’ll notice that the 
`motif` column contains two variations of the sequence motif:


~~~
distinct(rpts2, motif)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 2 x 1
  motif        
  <chr>        
1 CCTCCCTGACCAC
2 CCTCCCTAGCCAC
~~~
{: .output}

One way to compare these is by grouping and coloring the loess curves by motif sequence:


~~~
ggplot(data = rpts2, mapping = aes(x=dist, y=recom)) + geom_point(size=1) + geom_smooth(aes(color=motif), method="loess", se=FALSE, span=1/10)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'
~~~

Alternatively, we can split these motifs apart visually with 
facets using ggplot2’s `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()`.

### `Facet_wrap()`

To facet your plot by a single variable, use `facet_wrap()`. `facet_wrap()` takes a 
factor column, creates a panel for each level and wraps around horizontally. 
The first argument of `facet_wrap()` should be a formula, which you create with `~` 
followed by a variable name.


~~~
p <- ggplot(data = rpts2, mapping = aes(x=dist, y=recom)) + geom_point(size=1, color="grey")
p <- p + geom_smooth(method='loess', se=FALSE, span=1/10)
p <- p + facet_wrap(~ motif)
print(p)
~~~

~~~

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-unnamed-chunk-37-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-37" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-37" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


### `Facet_grid()`
To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, add `facet_grid()` to your plot call. 
The first argument of `facet_grid()` is also a formula. This time the formula should contain 
two variable names separated by a `~`. 

If you prefer to not facet in the rows or columns dimension, use a `.` instead of a 
variable name, e.g. `+ facet_grid(. ~ motif)`.

We see some patterns emerging here: motif CCTCCCTAGCCAC on 
a THE1B repeat background has a strong effect on recombination
rate, as does CCTCCCTGACCAC on a L2 repeat background. 
You can get a sense of the data that goes into this plot with:

One important feature of `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()` 
is that by default, x- and y-scales will be the same across 
all panels. You can set scales to be free with scales="free_x" 
and scales="free_y", or scales="free" to free both axes. 

For example:


~~~
p <- ggplot(rpts2, aes(x=dist, y=recom)) + geom_point(size=1, color="grey")
p <- p + geom_smooth(method='loess', se=FALSE, span=1/10)
p <- p + facet_wrap( ~ motif, scales="free_y")

## Saving the plot
`ggsave()` is a convenient function for saving a plot. It defaults to saving the last plot that you displayed, using the size of the current graphics device. It also guesses the type of graphics device from the extension.

## The layered grammar of graphics

In the previous sections, you learned much more than how to make scatterplots, bar charts, and boxplots. You learned a foundation that you can use to make _any_ type of plot with ggplot2. To see this, let's add position adjustments, stats, coordinate systems, and faceting to our code template:

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

Our new template takes seven parameters, the bracketed words that appear in the template. 
In practice, you rarely need to supply all seven parameters to make a graph because 
ggplot2 will provide useful defaults for everything except the data, the mappings, 
and the geom function.

The seven parameters in the template compose the grammar of graphics, a formal 
system for building plots. The grammar of graphics is based on the insight that 
you can uniquely describe _any_ plot as a combination of a dataset, a geom, a
set of mappings, a stat, a position adjustment, a coordinate system, and a faceting scheme. 

You could use this method to build _any_ plot that you imagine. In other words, you can use the code template that you've learned in this chapter to build hundreds of thousands of unique plots.

## ggplot2 calls

So far we've been very explicit with ggplot2 code:


~~~
ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = eruptions)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.25)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Typically, the first one or two arguments to a function are so important that you should know them by heart. The first two arguments to `ggplot()` are `data` and `mapping`, and the first two arguments to `aes()` are `x` and `y`. And if you know them by heart, you don't need to type them! That makes it easier to see what's different between plots. Rewriting the previous plot more concisely yields:


~~~
ggplot(faithful, aes(eruptions)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.25)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Sometimes we'll turn the end of a pipeline of data transformation into a plot. Watch for the transition from `%>%` to `+`. This transition is necessary because ggplot2 was created before the pipe was discovered.

# Data structures {#data-structures}

R's base data structures can be organized by their dimensionality (1d, 2d, or nd) 
and whether they're homogeneous (all contents must be of the same type) or 
heterogeneous (the contents can be of different types): 

|    | Homogeneous   | Heterogeneous |
|----|---------------|---------------|
| 1d | Atomic vector | List          |
| 2d | Matrix        | Data frame    |
| nd | Array         |               |

Almost all other objects are built upon these foundations. 
Note that R has no 0-dimensional, or scalar types. Individual numbers or strings 
are vectors of length one. 

Given an object, the best way to understand what data structures it's composed 
of is to use `str()`. `str()` is short for structure and it gives a compact, 
human readable description of any R data structure.

## Vectors {#vectors}

The basic data structure in R is the vector. Vectors come in two flavors: 
atomic vectors and lists. They have three common properties:

* Type, `typeof()`, what it is.
* Length, `length()`, how many elements it contains.
* Attributes, `attributes()`, additional arbitrary metadata.

They differ in the types of their elements: all elements of an atomic vector 
must be the same type, whereas the elements of a list can have different types.

### Atomic vectors

There are four common types of atomic vectors : **logical**, **integer**, 
**double** (often called numeric), and **character**.

Atomic vectors are usually created with `c()`, short for combine.


~~~
dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
# With the L suffix, you get an integer rather than a double
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
# Use TRUE and FALSE (or T and F) to create logical vectors
log_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)
chr_var <- c("these are", "some strings")
~~~
{: .language-r}

Atomic vectors are always flat, even if you nest `c()`'s: Try `c(1, c(2, c(3, 4)))`

Missing values are specified with `NA`, which is a logical vector of length 1. 
`NA` will always be coerced to the correct type if used inside `c()`.

#### Coercion

All elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, so when you attempt to 
combine different types they will be __coerced__ to the most flexible type. The 
coercion rules go: `logical` -> `integer` -> `double` -> `complex` -> `character`, 
where -> can be read as *are transformed into*. You can try to force coercion 
against this flow using the `as.` functions:

> 
> ~~~

> b <- c(TRUE, 1)
> c <- c(1L, 10)

> ~~~

> > 
> > 
> > 
> > ~~~
> > [1] "character"
> > ~~~
> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

When a logical vector is coerced to an integer or double, `TRUE` becomes 1 and `FALSE` becomes 0. 
This is very useful in conjunction with `sum()` and `mean()`


~~~
x <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
as.numeric(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0 0 1
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# Total number of TRUEs
sum(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# Proportion that are TRUE
mean(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.3333333
~~~
{: .output}

Coercion often happens automatically. Most mathematical functions (`+`, `log`, `abs`, etc.) will coerce to a double or integer, and most logical operations (`&`, `|`, `any`, etc) will coerce to a logical. You will usually get a warning message if the coercion might lose information. If confusion is likely, explicitly coerce with `as.character()`, `as.double()`, `as.integer()`, or `as.logical()`. 

### Lists

Lists are different from atomic vectors because their elements can be of any type, including lists. You construct lists by using `list()` instead of `c()`:


~~~
x <- list(1:3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(2.3, 5.9))
str(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
List of 4
 $ : int [1:3] 1 2 3
 $ : chr "a"
 $ : logi [1:3] TRUE FALSE TRUE
 $ : num [1:2] 2.3 5.9
~~~
{: .output}

Lists are sometimes called __recursive__ vectors, because a list can contain other lists. This makes them fundamentally different from atomic vectors.


~~~
x <- list(list(list(list())))
str(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
List of 1
 $ :List of 1
  ..$ :List of 1
  .. ..$ : list()
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
is.recursive(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

`c()` will combine several lists into one. If given a combination of atomic vectors and lists, `c()` will coerce the vectors to lists before combining them. Compare the results of `list()` and `c()`:


~~~
x <- list(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
y <- c(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
str(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
List of 2
 $ :List of 2
  ..$ : num 1
  ..$ : num 2
 $ : num [1:2] 3 4
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
str(y)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
List of 4
 $ : num 1
 $ : num 2
 $ : num 3
 $ : num 4
~~~
{: .output}

The `typeof()` a list is `list`. You can test for a list with `is.list()` and coerce to a list with `as.list()`. You can turn a list into an atomic vector with `unlist()`. If the elements of a list have different types, `unlist()` uses the same coercion rules as `c()`.

### Attributes {#attributes}

All objects can have arbitrary additional attributes, used to store metadata 
about the object. Attributes can be thought of as a named list (with unique names). 
Attributes can be accessed individually with `attr()` or all at once (as a list) 
with `attributes()`.

The three most important attributes:

* Names, a character vector giving each element a name, described in 
  [names](#vector-names). 

* Dimensions, used to turn vectors into matrices and arrays, 
  described in [matrices and arrays](#matrices-and-arrays).

* Class, used to implement the S3 object system.
 
Each of these attributes has a specific accessor function to get and set values. 
When working with these attributes, use `names(x)`, `dim(x)`, and `class(x)`, 
not `attr(x, "names")`, `attr(x, "dim")`, and `attr(x, "class")`.

#### Names {#vector-names}

You can name elements in a vector in three ways:

* When creating it: 

~~~
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
x
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
a b c 
1 2 3 
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
names(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "a" "b" "c"
~~~
{: .output}

* By modifying an existing vector in place: 

~~~
x <- 1:3; names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c")
~~~
{: .language-r}

* By creating a modified copy of a vector: 

~~~
x <- 1:3
x <- setNames(x, c("a", "b", "c"))
~~~
{: .language-r}

Names don't have to be unique and not all elements of a vector need to have a name. 
If some names are missing, `names()` will return an empty string for those elements. 
If all names are missing, `names()` will return `NULL`.


~~~
y <- c(a = 1, 2, 3)
names(y)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "a" ""  "" 
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
z <- c(1, 2, 3)
names(z)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
NULL
~~~
{: .output}

You can create a new vector without names using `unname(x)`, or remove names in 
place with `names(x) <- NULL`.

#### Factors

One important use of attributes is to define factors. A factor is a vector that 
can contain only predefined values, and is used to store categorical data. 
Factors are built on top of integer vectors using two attributes: the `class()`, 
"factor", which makes them behave differently from regular integer vectors, and 
the `levels()`, which defines the set of allowed values.


~~~
x <- c("a", "b", "b", "a")
x
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "a" "b" "b" "a"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
x <- factor(x)
x
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] a b b a
Levels: a b
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "factor"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
levels(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "a" "b"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# You can't use values that are not in the levels
x[2] <- "c"
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning in `[<-.factor`(`*tmp*`, 2, value = "c"): invalid factor level, NA
generated
~~~
{: .warning}



~~~
x
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] a    <NA> b    a   
Levels: a b
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# NB: combining factors will produce unwanted results!
c(x, factor("b"))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1]  1 NA  2  1  1
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(c(x, factor("b")))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
~~~
{: .output}

Factors are useful when you know the possible values a variable may take. Using 
a factor instead of a character vector makes it obvious when some groups contain 
no observations:


~~~
sex_char <- c("m", "m", "m")
sex_factor <- factor(sex_char, levels = c("m", "f"))

table(sex_char)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
sex_char
m 
3 
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
table(sex_factor)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
sex_factor
m f 
3 0 
~~~
{: .output}

Factors crip up all over R, and occasionally cause headaches for new R users (R 4.0!).

#### Matrices and arrays {#matrices-and-arrays}

Adding a `dim()` attribute to an atomic vector allows it to behave like a 
multi-dimensional __array__. A special case of the array is the __matrix__, which has two dimensions. Matrices are used commonly as part of the mathematical machinery of statistics. Arrays are much rarer, but worth being aware of.

Matrices and arrays are created with `matrix()` and `array()`, or by using the assignment form of `dim()`:


~~~
# Two scalar arguments to specify rows and columns
a <- matrix(1:6, ncol = 3, nrow = 2)
# One vector argument to describe all dimensions
b <- array(1:12, c(2, 3, 2))

# You can also modify an object in place by setting dim()
c <- 1:12
dim(c) <- c(3, 4)
c
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    4    7   10
[2,]    2    5    8   11
[3,]    3    6    9   12
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
dim(c) <- c(4, 3)
c
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    5    9
[2,]    2    6   10
[3,]    3    7   11
[4,]    4    8   12
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
dim(c) <- c(2, 3, 2)
c
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
, , 1

     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
[2,]    2    4    6

, , 2

     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    7    9   11
[2,]    8   10   12
~~~
{: .output}

You can test if an object is a matrix or array using `is.matrix()` and `is.array()`, or by looking at the length of the `dim()`. `as.matrix()` and `as.array()` make it easy to turn an existing vector into a matrix or array.

## Data frames {#data-frames}

A data frame is the most common way of storing data in R, and if 
[used systematically](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) makes data 
analysis easier. Under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors. 
This makes it a 2-dimensional structure, so it shares properties of both the 
matrix and the list.

> ## Useful Data Frame Functions
>
> * `head()` - shows first 6 rows
> * `tail()` - shows last 6 rows
> * `dim()` - returns the dimensions of data frame (i.e. number of rows and number of columns)
> * `nrow()` - number of rows
> * `ncol()` - number of columns
> * `str()` - structure of data frame - name, type and preview of data in each column
> * `names()` - shows the `names` attribute for a data frame, which gives the column names.
> * `sapply(dataframe, class)` - shows the class of each column in the data frame
{: .callout}

### Creation

You create a data frame using `data.frame()`, which takes named vectors as input:


~~~
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
str(df)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
'data.frame':	3 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ x: int  1 2 3
 $ y: chr  "a" "b" "c"
~~~
{: .output}

Beware `data.frame()`'s default behaviour which turns strings into factors. Use `stringAsFactors = FALSE` to suppress this behaviour!


~~~
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = c("a", "b", "c"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(df)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
'data.frame':	3 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ x: int  1 2 3
 $ y: chr  "a" "b" "c"
~~~
{: .output}

### Testing and coercion

Because a `data.frame` is an S3 class, its type reflects the underlying vector used to build it: the list. To check if an object is a data frame, use `class()` or test explicitly with `is.data.frame()`:


~~~
is.vector(df)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] FALSE
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
is.list(df)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
is.data.frame(df)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
typeof(df)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "list"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(df)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "data.frame"
~~~
{: .output}

You can coerce an object to a data frame with `as.data.frame()`:

- A vector will create a one-column data frame.
- A list will create one column for each element; it's an error if they're 
  not all the same length.
- A matrix will create a data frame with the same number of columns and rows as the matrix.
